        <p>Dear {{$user['name']}},</p>
        <p>Welcome to Walk and Earn</p>
        <p>
          Walk and Earn is an app where you get paid for Walking. So there are two great benefits of this app - </p>

          <p>1. Walk and make yourself healthy and fit.</p> 
          <p>2. Earn real money when you walk.</p>

          <p>Doesn't it sound great!</p>

          <p>Every 100 steps rewards you with 1 SweatCoin. Use SweatCoins to redeem the money in your PayTm account.</p>

         <p> How it works:</p>

          <p>Every step you take is rewarded with SweatCoins. These SweatCoins can be used to redeem ACTUAL MONEY to your PayTm account!</p>

          <p>100 steps = 1 SweatCoin</p>

          <p>To motivate you along the journey of walking as much as possible, we tried to make Walk and Earn more interesting.</p>

          <p>The maximum SweatCoins you can earn in a day, is based on how much you walk. As you walk more you earn more.</p>

          <p>And to make the journey a lot more fun, you get to invite your friends. For every referral you and your friend will get 50 Sweatcoins each.</p>

          <p>So excited for this new journey? Just go Walk and Earn!</p>
